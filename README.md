# Ghar-Jagga

This is a Property Listings and Realtors based website, where visitors can contact respective realtors for enquiring into specific properties.
The whole backend of the project is in Django, with its frontend in Bootstrap's theme.

Still working on it !!
Learned to integrate PostgreSQL in the backend, recording data and serving them in the server and much more!
